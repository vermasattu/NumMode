## Auto-Launch at Windows Startup

To make NumMode start automatically when your PC turns on:

1. Press `Win + R` to open the Run dialog.  
2. Type `shell:startup` and press Enter (opens your personal Startup folder).

## Why It’s Useful

Many keyboards don’t include a numpad. NumMode gives you a **virtual numpad layer** without changing your hardware — simple, fast, and efficient.

## Notes

- The app is fully portable and can be placed in Startup to auto-launch with Windows.
